# Pico_servo_radar
i reccomend thonny for this code because thats what it was developed on and im not sure if other ide's work
for the setup you need a servo connected to the pico and an IR sensor connected. I used the one in the photo but you can use any that work

i used a rubberband to connect it to the top of the servo but you can use anything that works
for the code to work you will have to adjust the GPIO pins that you connected the sensor and servo to
i would reccomend using some tape to hold the wires because they can get in the way of turning when the code is activated
the turning will stop when the sensor is activated and you can change the text that appears when you start the code and when the sensor is activated
thats all for instructions so go have some fun messing around with this :)
